Breadcrumb Dashboard

Was trying this solution of converting the "CoreUI" package into CSHTML / a ASP.NET Core solution and using that breadcrumb scheme.

Ultimately, didn't think the scheme was "dynamic enough" to create breadcrumbs outside of the dashboard and home page in a more automated fashion.
